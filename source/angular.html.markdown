# Adventures in AngularJS

I spend the vast majority of my day in and out of the AngularJS source code and investigating ways to make my client-side apps even more fun to work with. My favorite thing to do as of late has been building out a sufficient test harness for all of my AngularJS projects, along with discovering new and interesting ways to build awesome apps while avoiding some of the jQuery ugliness of my past.

In this series, I am going to steer away from the sequential nature of my [RubyMotion](/rubymotion) column, and instead use this as a sounding board for all of my thoughts relating to the world of AngularJS. You'll find **a lot** of talk about testing, and hopefully some interesting approaches to using Angular Services and Directives in surprising ways.

- [Testing: Testing Directives + Their Templates](/blog/angular-testing-directives)
- Testing: Inherited Controllers
- Testing: $httpBackend.flush()
- Services: Methods that return promises
- Directives: Styled Checkbox
