# Building podstud.io in RubyMotion

Over the past few months, I have found myself wanting more and more out of the iPhone apps that I use to listen to podcasts on a daily basis. Either the UI itself was a little too confusing, my subscriptions would not update reliably, or some edge feature was not going to be available for quite some time. It was at this time that I was also tasked with creating a native iOS app during a Hackathon at [Backupify](http://www.backupify.com). I spend most of my day in the world of Ruby on Rails..so I thought it would be nice to be able to bring some of my ruby knowledge with me on my journey in iOS development. So, I bought a license for [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion) and decided to dive in head-first to see if I could create my own podcast management app.

The community and ecosystem behind RubyMotion is truly amazing. Everyone I have encountered has been incredibly passionate about what they do and helpful whenever possible. But, I noticed there aren't a ton of places to look for examples of large, sufficiently complex applications. So, I have decided to use this blog as a vehicle to build the podstud.io app from scratch, and hopefully provide a glimpse into the evolution of an app from start to finish.

I have a vague idea of the direction I want this series (and the app itself) to take, but that is subject to change based on any new concepts or ideas I happen to run into along the way. Oh...and I should mention that all the code from this series and the app itself will be open-source and available on GitHub so that you can follow along at your own pace.
