I'm a Front End Engineer living in Boston, MA. Currently, I am the Lead Front End Engineer at [Backupify](http://wwww.backupify.com) where the vast majority of my day is spent between [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). I am in the process of developing a Podcast Management App called **podstud.io**.

I want this site to be a living account of my development efforts across a variety of disciplines, including [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and the very cool [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). My posts and articles will be divided up amongst a number of series, in the hopes of creating a much more thorough and digestable path to learning and mastering these frameworks.

> [**Building podstud.io in RubyMotion:**](/rubymotion) Currently this is the primary focus of this site. I will be building the **podstud.io** app from scratch and providing a step-by-step guide to the development process in RubyMotion. This series was originally inspired by the [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/), and I hope to follow in its footsteps by providing a great resource for anyone looking to develop and ship real, production-ready native iOS applications using RubyMotion. As I am still in the learning stages with RubyMotion and iOS development, this is a great series to follow and see how I build this podcast app from the ground up and explore new concepts along the way.

> [**Adventures in Angular**](/angular) This series will follow a less structured approach than my others and is not necessarily focused on the construction of the **podstud.io** app. Instead, I will be discussing my recent work and discoveries in the world of AngularJS. Topics like testing, advanced directive techniques and various data modeling approaches are all examples of topics I will be covering.
